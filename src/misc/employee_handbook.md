## 1. Welcome to Jurassic Park

Congratulations on joining the world’s premier prehistoric wildlife preserve. Jurassic Park combines cutting-edge biotechnology with a theme park experience unlike any other. Our mission is to **educate, entertain, and occasionally terrify**—all while maintaining the highest standards of safety and scientific integrity.

## 2. Core Values

- **Safety First** – Especially yours.
- **Scientific Integrity** – Just because we *can* doesn’t mean we *should* (but we probably will).

All employees are expected to:

- Follow all security protocols at all times  
- Respect restricted areas (yes, *even if you’re curious*)
